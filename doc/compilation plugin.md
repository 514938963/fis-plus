##A Toolset For Production

FIS automation tool is not just a task runner, more precisely speaking, it is a toolset for porduction. You can start working quickly without configuring a lot of independent tasks. The plugins system simply takes files, processes them, and pipes them to the next step. If you need to do something different, itâ€™s rather simple: the fis config is simply a JavaScript file, so you can pull in existing node modules, run them, and be on your way.
